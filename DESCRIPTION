Description: Relative, generalized, and Erreygers
    corrected concentration index; plot Lorenz curves; and decompose health
    inequalities using (generalized) linear models, survival models, survey+weighted, and marginal effects probit models.
    Forked by Brecht Devleesschauwer from the 'decomp' package originally (no longer on CRAN), now maintained by Kaspar Walter Meili. Compared to the earlier 'rineq' version on 'github' by Brecht Devleesschauwer (<https://github.com/brechtdv/rineq>), the regression tree functionality has been removed for now. 
    Improvements compared to earlier versions include improved plotting of decomposition and concentration, and added functionality to calculate the concentration index with different methods, calculation of robust standard errors, and support for marginal effects probit regression for decomposition. The development version is available at <https://github.com/kdevkdev/rineq>.
