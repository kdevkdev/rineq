## rineq


_Statistical Analysis of Health Inequalities_

The `rineq` package provides functions to  calculate the relative, generalized, and Erreygers corrected concentration index; plot Lorenz curves; and decompose health inequalities using (generalized) linear models, survival models, and regression and binary trees.

#### Available functions

<table>
<tr><td><code>ci</code></td><td>Calculate the relative, generalized, or Erreygers corrected concentration index</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>correct_sign</code></td><td>Correct negative values in the health variable</td></tr>
</table>

Decomposition
<table>
<tr><td><code>contribution</code></td><td>Decompose the Relative Concentration Index into its components</td></tr>
</table>
